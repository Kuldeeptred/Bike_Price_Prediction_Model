# 🚲 Bike Price Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bike Price Prediction Model** is a machine learning project designed to predict the resale price of used bikes based on various features such as bike brand, model year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and ownership details. This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `Used_Bikes.csv`
- The dataset contains historical data of used bike listings with relevant attributes required for price prediction.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training
- Model serialization using Pickle
- Price prediction using a Python application

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Regression-based model trained using **Scikit-learn**
- Model saved as `bike_model.pkl` for reuse without retraining
